## Dataset

> The dataset includes the 2018 dataset for Ford Bike. This data set basically shows how often this bikes are use and by which gender in which place. Since, these data are given in a month basis, I have combined the dataset to a single dataframe to make sure that when we explore the data it would be easy for us. The dataset includes the  1018386 trips that has happened throughout the year in 2018.

## Summary of Findings

1. Total Average trips 
2. Average trip based on gender 
3. Trend of average time based on monthly bike ride
4. Relationship between rides and gender
I strated analysising the data at first looking at the data structure. To make sure that data is fine intially, I started data wrangling by joining 7 months of data to a single data frame. 

During data exploration, I look at the average trips made by people based on seconds, minutes and hours. To support the features initally, I cleaned some of the data like dropping , converting data types, also determining the age based upon the birth year. During exploration, I came to find out that more bike trips duration are in summer and also by customer rather than sucriber.As my assumption, customer might be the tourist who come to visit the plac while suscriber might be the regular commuter for work. Also, looking at distribution most rides are taken by 20-40 ages of people. Also, trips are made by male more than female. Also, number of suscriber takes the most bike rides.
